# [List Pagination and Filtering](https://gsosa2000.github.io/List-Pagination-and-Filtering/)
## **Grade:** :heavy_check_mark: Exceeds Expectations
### **Premise** 
>In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that is displaying way too much information all at once. Long lists don't make for a good user experience on a web page. To make it easier for the user to find information and read the page, you'll add to this project a popular web development technique known as "pagination".
### **Project Instructions**
1. Show/hide the appropriate students
2. Create and append the pagination links
3. Add functionality to pagination links with an event listener
4. Add code comments.
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Your code includes comment which demonstrates all your hard work. It is a necessary skill for a developer and in future your fellow developers and your inner self will thank you for this skill.
5. Cross-Browser consistency
### Extra Credit
1. Add search component
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Yes a search bar ! Also you have an awesome job using unobtrusive JavaScript.
2. Add functionality to the search component
3. Paginate search results
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Nicely done. Pagination links generate perfectly and great work on the functionality of the search input You have used objects for the pages which was a brilliant idea. Awesome !
4. Handle no results returned
   - #### Reviewer Comments:
   - > Correct number of students are shown on each page. Also, the search provides feedback if no student is found. But it would be a better if the message 'searched student doesn't exists' was printed on the body of the page instead of the alert.
### Overall Comments
> You have done a fabulous job here. The App works perfectly and exceeds all the expectations. The comments in your code are great, you have used objects with properties and methods inside which was a brilliant approach and the script file is cleaner and well organized. Well done.

> Your next project is about an Interactive Form. The project is all about details with a lot of fun. I want you to shoot for the exceeds again next time.

> Best of luck and happy coding. You rock !
